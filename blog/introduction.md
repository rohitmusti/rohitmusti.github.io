Welcome! I have occasionally felt the urge to blog or journal, but I never made a consistent habit of it. I have recently felt inspired by the ideas I have encountered in blogs of my friends and people I look up to and felt a burning desire to catalogue my thoughts. I immediately started over thinking this and checking out complex note taking systems (like obsidian) for linking ideas. Quickly, I became overwhelmed by the possibilities and set the whole concept of tracking my favorite ideas aside.

This Friday night I was looking through my long back log of exciting projects and this one struck my eye! My goal with this blog is to explore ideas as I encounter them and catalogue my adventures in cyberspace. I don't expect anyone to ever read this, but I hope that if you find yourself here, you find a kindred spirit in me. If you find an error or an incomplete idea on this blog, please feel free to reach out to me through my contact page!
