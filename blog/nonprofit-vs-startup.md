My first job out of graduate school was working at [American Forests](https://americanforests.org/). This was incredibly fulfilling! I got to work on extremely impactful projects (like the [Tree Equity Score](https://treeequityscore.org/)) and learned about what it meant to contribute value to an organization. After a couple of years, I felt myself less and less challenged by the software and data engineering. I began job hunting and eventually joined [Read AI](https://read.ai/). This was a difficult decision. Ultimately, the wonderful vibes and energy at Read from everyone on the team made me feel confident that I would have a ton of fun and the opportunity to learn/grow faster than I ever had before. I couldn't be happier with my decision.

After about 6 months at Read, I feel ready to draw some comparisons on the similarities and differences of working at a non-profit vs a start-up.

## Similarities

1. **Strapped for cash**: At both American Forests and Read, there has always been enough money to pay the bills and make payroll. But it has always been clear that, in the long-term, it is important to bring in money. In non-profits, that is usually in the form of grants and donations. At start-ups, that is in the form of paying customers. I've never experienced working at a massive organization so I can't comment on that from direct experience. But, based on the descriptions from friends and colleagues, at larger organizations, the emphasis on bringing in new forms of revenue is less clear to engineers and teams are generally focused on customer retention, lowering costs, and increasing reliability.

1. **Stakeholders**: In non-profits, you have funding stakeholders and the communities you are serving. In start-ups, you have investors and customers. In both scenarios, the organizations focus on the end users, but the funders and investors are not to be forgotten. This dual-class of stakeholders makes for a small tension in both organizations.

1. **Impact**: At both non-profits and start-ups, individual contributers can have a huge impact on the overall growth and value of the organizations. Unlike large corporations, there is a much clearer connection between the work you are doing and the value it provides. This makes for an incredible sense of purpose and drive to succeed at these types of organizations.

1. **Compensation**: Given the financial pressure on start ups and non-profits, you will not be paid as much as you would be if you were at a large corporation.

## Differences

1. **Stakeholder Incentive Alignment**: This difference between the non-profit and start-up stakeholders is the incentive alignment. In non-profits, the funders want to see their money going towards supporting the mission. The tension in non-profits is that the organizations need to treat their employees fairly while keeping their overhead as low as possible. This trim-rate, is commonly used in evaluating and ranking non-profits. In start-ups, the investors want to see the business succeed and grow. Funders want as low a trim-rate as possible so that there money has the largest impact on the communities the non-profit serves. Non-profits want to serve their communities without burning out their employees, that means providing them with good working conditions. Those good working conditions, increase the trim-rate, creating the tension. In start-ups, the investors are more focused on the business growing as quickly as possible to see a faster return on their investment. Baked into that incentive is hiring good engineers that can produce quickly. As such, there is more recognition that investing in the employees is a core part of that organization succeeding. They recognize that investing in employees results in a better product for the customers. start-ups have a cleaner incentive alignment.

1. **Frequency of Fundraising**: Another difference in stakeholders is that non-profits also have to continually raise money from funders where as start-ups are generally trying to achieve a sustainable business model that can exist without investor support. start-ups only reach for investment during periods where growing requires spending more money their cashflow allows. This means that investors in start-ups are willing to accept greater risks on the promise of huge returns on their money. Funders in non-profits, want to see a more direct and immediate return of value on their funding.

1. **Mission**: When working at American Forests, the mission of saving and revitalizing America's forests was an incredibly inspiring mission. It was extremely easy to feel inspired each morning when you consider the lofty goals you are trying to achieve. Working at a start up creating a b2b software to make meetings better is just not as inspiring. Do not get me wrong, I think the tools we are building are useful, valuable, and that they will improve meetings and the quality of life of our customers. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be working at Read. However, if you zero in the on the mission of the different organizations, American Forests is clearly more inspiring.

1. **Compensation**: At start ups, you are generally granted some sort of equity into the organization. As the organization grows in value, that equity grows in value as well. Because start ups start out with relatively cheap stock, if the company succeeds, that stock can become a life changing amount of money. Definitely higher risk than a large corporation, but potentially a much bigger reward!

## Conclusions

Working at both American Forests and Read AI has been a great experience and I feel extremely grateful for the opportunities that have come my way. I don't think you can say working at either a non-profit or a start-up is strictly better than the other. Rather, they have very different pros and cons and at different points in your life, you may be more excited by one than the other!
