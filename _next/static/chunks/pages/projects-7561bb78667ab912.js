The goal of the project was to produce a bot that used NLP to scan Red Hat's technical documentation and respond to questions based on the documentation. The approach we took was context based question and answering. However, we quickly ran into the hard wall of technical text being too similar to one another to differentiate meaningfully using context based approaches. I designed and implemented several experiments to improve this methodology however this fundamental challenge to measuring text similarity stopped us from bringing the product to production.",code_link:[{name:"Question Answer Bot Experiments",link:"https://github.com/rohitmusti/Question-Answer-Engine-RH"}]},{title:"Natural Language Processing Graduate Work",description:"Conversations within multilingual communities rarely select and stick to a single language or dialect in the repertoire. Rather, speakers navigate between codes which carry crucial social meaning. These switches happen between paragraphs, sentences, or even words. Annotating the code and identifying switches throughout a discourse is both critical and laborious for sociolinguistics. Our ability to collect large quantities of conversational data is rapidly outpacing our ability to process the data. A natural language processing model which automatically segments text into its coded components will be essential for researchers in this field to take advantage of the recent influx of data. The problem statement was can I develop a deep learning based approach to identifying code switches. I developed a series of neural nets to identify which code a given word is and a larger recurrent neural net to predict the class of the next word, thus predicting the code switch. The final model achieved over 90% accuracy!"},{title:"Compilers Graduate Work",description:"Type checking is the process of separating typable programs (free of type errors) from non-typable programs. Once a program is known to be type safe, several optimizations can be added to the program.
